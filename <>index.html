    <p>Thomas J. Watson was a pioneer in the development of accounting and computing 
        equipment used today by business, government, science and industry. 
        He built a worldwide industry during his 42 years at IBM.<br><br>

        Mr. Watson was born in Campbell, N.Y., February 17, 1874. His first job was at age 18 as a 
        bookkeeper in Clarence Risley's Market in Painted Post, N.Y. Later he sold sewing machines and musical 
        instruments before joining the National Cash Register Company as a salesman in Buffalo. He eventually 
        worked his way up to general sales manager. Bent on inspiring the dispirited NCR sales force, Mr. Watson 
        introduced the motto, "THINK," which later became a widely known symbol of IBM.<br><br>
        Throughout his life, Mr. Watson maintained a deep interest in international relations. 
        He adopted for IBM the slogan, "World Peace Through World Trade," worked closely with the International 
        Chamber of Commerce and in 1937 was elected its president. For many years Mr. Watson served as a trustee 
        of Columbia University and Lafayette College. He was presented with honorary degrees by 27 colleges and 
        universities in the United States and four abroad.<br><br>
        
        Mr. Watson was named chairman in September 1949. A month before his death on June 19, 1956, Mr. Watson handed
         over the reins of the company to his eldest son, Thomas J. Watson, Jr. Another son, Arthur K. Watson, served as 
         president of IBM World Trade Corp., the company's international operations.
